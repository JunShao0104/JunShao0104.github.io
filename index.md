## About Me

My name is Lingjun Zhao (Jason) and 赵凌隽 in Chinese. I spent the first 18 years of my life living in my hometown, Shanghai and took the later 4 years for my undergraduate in Tianjin. Now I'm a second-year <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank"> Robotics</a> Master Student at <a href="https://umich.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Michigan</a>'s <a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank"> Robotics Institute</a>, supervised by Prof.<a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/profile/katherine-skinner/" target="_blank"> Katie Skinner</a>. I have been working as a research assistant in <a href="https://fcav.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UM Ford Center for Autnonomous Vehicles (FCAV)</a> since Jan. 2023. I am interested in Robotics, Computer Vision and their applications in Self-driving Cars.

Prior to joining the Master program, I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm" target = "_blank"> Tianjin University</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "http://faculty.tju.edu.cn/FujunWang/en/index.htm" target = "_blank"> Fujun Wang</a> and Prof. <a href="http://faculty.tju.edu.cn/SongLe/en/index.htm" target = "_blank"> Le Song</a>. During my undergraduate period, I worked on Soft Robot, Surgical Robot and Vision-based Tactile Sensor.

Outside of academia, I began my journey as an amateur scoccer player since my middle school. Badminton and table tennis are also my favorite sports. I'm also passionate about photography and travelling.
